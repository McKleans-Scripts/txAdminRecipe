# Forked Version of QBCORE Recipe

This is laid out how I personally have my servers set up.

In this Recipe I have set up every free asset you can get on Github from great content creators.

## Do Note ##
Something's are missing due to using paid assets, for example theres no adminmenu as I use Snipes-AdminMenu

**Description:** Complete RP Server For FiveM based on QBCore.

This recipe runs inside [**txAdmin**](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin).
Please check the [**Recipe Documentation Page**](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/blob/master/docs/recipe.md).
