### Forked Version of QBCORE Recipe

## Description ##
This recipe is created to how I personally would recommend, with perhaps some changes here and there.
I would also have some heavy changes in quiet a few scripts.

This recipe runs inside [**txAdmin**](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin).
Please check the [**Recipe Documentation Page**](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/blob/master/docs/recipe.md).



In this Recipe I have set up every free asset you can get on Github from great content creators.
